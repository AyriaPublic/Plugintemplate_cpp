# Ayria Plugintemplate for C++

This repository serves as a startingpoint for new developers.
It provides some common utilities but the area of interest is the `Source/Appmain.cpp` module.
Here you'll find three common callbacks where you can insert your own code.
These are ofcourse optional and you can create your own plugin from scratch without them,
but they serve as convenient entrypoints.
